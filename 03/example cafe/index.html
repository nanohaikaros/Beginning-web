    <h1> EXAMPLE CAFF</h1>
    <p> Welcome to example cafe. We will be developing this site throughout the book. </p>
    <h2> A community cafe serving home cooked, locally sourced, organic food </h2>
    <p> With stunning views of the ocean, Example Cafe offers the perfect environment to unwind and recharge the batteries. </p>
    <p> Our menu offers a wide range of breakfasts, brunches and lunches, including a range of vegetarian options. </p>
    <p> Whether you sip on a fresh, hot coffee or a cooling smoothie, you never need to feel rushed - relax with friends or just watch the world go by. </p>
    <h2> This weekend's special brunch </h2>
    <p> This weekend, our season of special brunches continues with scrambled egg on an English muffin. Not for the faint-hearted, the secret to these eggs is that they are made with half cream and cooked in butter, with no more that four eggs in the pan at a time. </p>
